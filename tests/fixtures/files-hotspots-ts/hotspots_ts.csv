Above average rainfall is forecast for November December by Copernicus C3S Multimodel seasonal rainfall forecast, which should benefit winter and spring crops, after 3 seasons of dry conditions in particular in the northwest of the country (cf. https://agricultural-production-hotspots.ec.europa.eu/seasonal_forecast.php?sfreg=asia).

68,Haiti,2023-10-11,1,Hotspot,"Harvesting of rice is ongoing across the country and expected to be concluded at the end of November. Sorghum entered the vegetation stage. Maize (second) concluded the vegetation stage and is ready for harvest. Rainfall in the last month was normal across most cropping areas. Vegetation conditions were normal or above normal in most parts of the country, suggesting an average performance of the main cycle of rice and second cycle of maize. Wetter than normal conditions are expected for the month of November (<a href=""https://agricultural-production-hotspots.ec.europa.eu/seasonal_forecast/monthly-precipitation/forecast/monthly-percentile-probability-plot/multimod-2023_2023_09_2-3-north_america.png]Copernicus C3S Multimodel. This could benefit the sorghum cycle. However, wetter than normal conditions also bring a risk of floods and higher incidence of plant diseases, which could affect ongoing harvests. The last IPC analysis estimated that 44% of the population presented high levels of acute food insecurity (<a href=""https://www.ipcinfo.org/ipc-country-analysis/details-map/en/c/1156571/?iso3=HTI]IPC TWG Haiti, August 2023.",6,2,6
