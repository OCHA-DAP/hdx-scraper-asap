In the south (Naryn and Osh), precipitation since the start of season has been one of the lowest since 2001-02, however with no visible impact on crops biomass.";0;0;0

29;"Sudan";2024-02-11;2;"Major hotspot";"Sudan is climatologically from November to March. The previous main season was characterized by early onset in June and generally close to average rainfall conditions from July to September. However, the ongoing conflict negatively affected farming activities and caused a likely reduction in the area cultivated and below average crop conditions over the seasons could be observed. Irrigated areas around Khartoum show clearly lower active vegetation than in previous years: https://agricultural-production-hotspots.ec.europa.eu/s/9b67b1c9 Critical infrastructure has continued to be damaged and destroyed by the clashes, which have also interfered with trade, markets, and services, including humanitarian supplies, disrupting daily life and economic activity, and making it harder for households in the impacted areas to access food and sources of income. An expansion of the conflict during harvesting time in December and January to central and eastern Sudan has exacerbated food security problems. According to the IPC analysis for the second projection period between October 2023 to February 2024, 18 million people are classified in IPC Phase 3 or worse. Among these, 13 million people are in Crisis (IPC Phase 3), and 4.9 million people are in Emergency (IPC Phase 4). A new IPC analysis is ongoing.";1;0;1
33;"Mozambique";2024-02-11;0;"No hotspot";"The last 30 days have been characterized by poor rainfall conditions across the country. Zambezia, accounting for the 19.5% of the national cereal production, received 66% less precipitation compared to the long-term average. Similar conditions are present in Tete, where the reduced flow of the Zambezi River and its tributaries is clearly visible in the <a href=""https://agricultural-production-hotspots.ec.europa.eu/s/aaabf99a]ASAP high resolution viewer</a>. According to <a href=""https://www.fao.org/giews/countrybrief/country.jsp?code=MOZ&amp,lang=en]FAO</a>, a delayed start of seasonal rains across the country has potentially shortened the growing season, raising concerns regarding crop yield potentials. In northern provinces, also significant cereal producing regions, weather conditions have been more favourable for crop development. However, in Cabo Delgado Province, already grappling with several years of insecurity, recent attacks by non-state armed groups (NSAG) in January 2024 and localized flooding events at the start of the year have adversely affected households' access to land and agriculture inputs. Crop conditions in the three southern provinces remain relatively good particularly in Inhambane, where biomass is observed in average and some crops (16% of the total) are currently observed in abundant vegetation status. However, these provinces contribute less than 10% to the national cereal production (<a href=""https://reliefweb.int/report/mozambique/mozambique-displacement-northern-cabo-delgado-flash-update-no-2-02-february-2024-enpt]OCHA.";6;5;6

Cumulative rainfall has been normal to above normal in all cropping areas and vegetation conditions by February 20th were also normal or better than normal suggesting favourable progress of ongoing cycles.

51;"Madagascar";2024-02-11;0;"No hotspot";"In Madagascar, in the Central highlands, biomass of main season rice planted from November to January is average to above average as a result of close to average rainfall. In the northwest (Sofia, Boeny, Betsiboka) rice planting is still underway as shown by flooded fields. In the Grand South (Anosy, Androy and Atsimo Andrefana), maize biomass is slightly below average in local areas as a result of irregular rainfall in the last three months. In this latter region, it is estimated that about 1.3 million people are facing acute food insecurity (IPC phase 3 and above) as a result of previous droughts (2020, 2021 and 2022) and poor socio economic conditions.";8;7;11
